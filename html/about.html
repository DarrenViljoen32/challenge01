                    <caption><h4>Our Roots</h4></caption>
                    Our Shop was officially launched in October 2023, following the successful acquisition of an existing ecommerce business called There Shop by the RSA-based investment firm, LCA Global Management and Darren Viljoen in October 2022. Today, Our Shop is the leading ecommerce retailer in Life Choices Academy and one of the largest, most innovative ecommerce retailers on the African continent.

                    The business was initiated with a simple vision in mind: To be the largest, simplest, most customer-centric online shopping destination in Africa. It has rapidly evolved since inception, opening and expanding warehouses in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, while expanding department selection to over 21 departments across Electronics, Lifestyle, Media & Gaming and Fashion.

                    For Our Shop, 2022 was a truly pivotal year with the announcement of a R1m investment from LCA Global. This was quickly followed by the purchase of Mr Deli which gave the business ownership over its own logistics network through the Our Shop Delivery Team division and its own app-based on-demand food delivery service through the Our Shop division.

                    The same year saw the successful acquisition of myfirstwebsite.com, a curated design and fashion website, and culminated in the announcement that mysecondwebsite.com would be merging businesses with Our Shop building the premier online shopping destination in Africa. The merge was successfully completed on 1 May 2023 when all customer accounts were successfully transferred to Our Shop.

                    Beginning in early 2023, we increased our investment in Our Shop to 96%. In October 2023, myfirstwebsite.com merged to provide customers with the latest on-trend local and international fashion.

                    Now, Our Shop is Life Choices largest, most innovative ecommerce retailer, with over 1 employee. At the core of everything we do is our customer. We are passionate about providing great customer experiences, beginning with the moment you land on our site or app, until the product you order is delivered safely into your hands.
